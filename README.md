To showcase my projects and skills

Working on my HTML and CSS for the past two years now, Everything learned have been self taught with the help of Udemy courses and Youtube.

I got into building websites purely for he enjoyment of creating something from scratch and seeing it develop before my eyes, learning new things and improving my skills has been the best part and i will continue to enjoy learning along the way.
