# LandingPage
To showcase my projects and skills

Working on my HTML and CSS for the past two years now, Everything learned has been self taught with the help of Udemy courses and Youtube.

I got into building websites purely for the enjoyment of creating something from scratch and seeing it develop before my very eyes, learning new things and improving my skills has been the best part of the last two years and i will continue to enjoy learning along the way.
